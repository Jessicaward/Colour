# Colour
Source code for the game prototype I created for my EPQ.

The game uses C# with XNA 4.0.

I started development on the game in November 2016 and finished in March 2017.

The game has two main objectives:
Spread colour around the world and defeat enemies. These objectives are to be achieved in the fastest time possible.
